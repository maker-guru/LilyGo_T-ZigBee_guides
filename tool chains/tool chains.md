#Tool chains for LilyGo T-ZigBee

The T-ZigBee module contains a ESP32-C3 and a TLSR825 microcontroller. Each microcontroller requires its own tool chain. 

## Tool chain for programming the ESP32-C3

Adoucette described how he got a tool chain up and running for programming the ESP32-C3 in [issue 21](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-ZigBee/issues/21#issuecomment-1566196339).
