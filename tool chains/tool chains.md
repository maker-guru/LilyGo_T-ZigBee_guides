# Tool chains for LilyGo T-ZigBee

The T-ZigBee module contains a ESP32-C3 and a TLSR8258 microcontroller. Each microcontroller requires its own tool chain. 

## Tool chain for programming the ESP32-C3

Adoucette described how he got a tool chain up and running for programming the ESP32-C3 in [issue 21](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-ZigBee/issues/21#issuecomment-1566196339).






## Tool chain for programming the TLSR8258

Telink provides a tool chain and IDE for creating firmware for the TLSR8258. In the release notes of the SDK there is a link where the preferred IDE for the relaese can be downloaded. For Version 3.7.1.1 it is Telink IoT Studio: [TelinkIoTStudio_V2024.8](https://wiki.telink-semi.cn/tools_and_sdk/Tools/IoTStudio/TelinkIoTStudio_V2024.8.zip).
